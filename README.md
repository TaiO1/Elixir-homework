These are my test cases written for Divvy's SDET homework.

There is a test file for each option in the sidebar menu on https://qa-homework.divvy.co/
Some test files are multiple tests, some of them are a single test. I tried to keep the focus on the things I was able to figure out using Elixir and Hound. 

There is also a file titled homework_api_tests.exs that contains all of the API tests written for this technical homework. 

A majority of the tests in this repo are happy path tests, with a few of them exploring some sad path scenarios, primarily to outline some of what I would focus on if I were tasked with testing the functionality in a professional setting.
